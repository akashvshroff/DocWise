# DocWise: An AI PDF Analysis Tool
- DocWise is an AI tool, built using the OpenAI API and LangChain, that allows users to upload their own documents and *chat* with them. See it in action through the video below!
- The name of this tool was generated by ChatGPT, which used the following reasoning: "The name combines "Doc," a commonly used abbreviation for documents, and "Wise" to suggest the application's intelligence and expertise in analyzing PDF files. It conveys the idea that the application can provide valuable insights and understanding from PDF documents, making it a smart choice for users seeking efficient analysis".

## Purpose
- The tool is incredibly useful in helping you optimize your interaction with conversational models by allowing you to provide context to the model itself. You can use upload lectures notes for a class and ask the tool to recommend key words that you should learn before a test or you could upload a lengthy annual report for a company and get the model to summarize the financial performance of the company and help you understand whether it is a good investment. The possibilities are endless. 
- In effect, the tool is built by *chaining* a context engine, (by way of vector embeddings) to the conversational ability of the existing OpenAI models, thereby allowing you to leverage the conversational style and overcome ChatGPT's knowledge limitations.
- I built this tool to help me get experience working with LangChain and understanding how we can use the library to build solutions on top of existing AI models that extend their functionality and improve the process of working with them.

## Tech Breakdown
- The two sections briefly cover the tech that I used to build this system. I learnt a lot of the tools, especially on the langchain side, from Nicholas Renotte's wonderful tutorial that can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vQyTzNGVY&list=PLp7virpu8w7XuBgGJvEWZaLsBM-hnBjq1&index=13&t=195s&ab_channel=NicholasRenotte).
- LangChain covers the interaction with the OpenAI API and working with the user-uploaded file to generate the vector embeddings and Streamlit was used to generate a lightweight UI that facilitates interacting with the application.
